# who-ml-model
Using the World Health Organization health statistics dataset for life expectancy in different countires, I created a machine learning model using a Random Forest Regressor. 
Here are the steps I took to create my model:
1. Explore the data to get insights and determine my target variable
2. Create a training/testing dataset
3. Choose models to work with
4. Determine which model to proceed with
5. Fine Tune the model through Cross Validation
6. Simplify the model
